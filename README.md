## Introduction


Because this course falls in the "independent study" realm, the pace and topics it covers are determined by the student 
and instructor. My goals for this course are as follows: 

- To better organize large Python modules by reducing redundancies in functions, classes, and methods.
- To master SQLite CRUD operations within Python.   
- To optimize Python algorithm performance and speed when performed on large scales or computationally-heavy tasks.
- To further develop skills using Git and Github.

This course will make use of the free material readily available online. Specifically, many course sections and
assignments will adopted from two books:
- [Scientific Computing with Python 3 by FÃ¼hrer, Solem, and Verdier](https://github.com/oddsun/Free-Python-Books/blob/master/book/Scientific%20Computing%20with%20Python%203.pdf)
- [Python Data Structures and Algorithms by Benjamin Bata](https://github.com/oddsun/Free-Python-Books/blob/master/book/Python%20Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms.epub)

As the course progresses, the Table of Contents below will be updated to reflect each learning section and its location 
within this repository.
